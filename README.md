Hello, I'm Orren Fitch.

I'm interested in game design, and I have experience making graphics, textures, and other media for stand-alone computer game and mod projects. 

I'm comfortable designing user interfaces, and other interactive features. I'm comfortable working with HTML, CSS, and a few mark-up languages, like XML and ZenScript.

I'm working on finishing up a degree in graphic design, and I'm always looking to learn new skills.

I'm interested in collaborating in game-related projects, or anywhere that artwork, graphics, or design work is needed.

You can reach me at whomselfworth@gmail.com. My discord handle is whomself#1140
